I'm a Computer Science student at University of Bras√≠lia, Brazil! I'm passionate about movies and also about exploring the world through both technology and books. I'm driven by curiosity, whether it's diving into the possibilities of artificial intelligence, uncovering patterns in data, or reading incredible stories.

My main areas of interest and work include AI, machine learning, and data engineering. I enjoy building systems that are not only intelligent but also efficient and meaningful. 

I'm a very proactive, ambitious and dedicated student. Because of that, In my third year of undergrad, I was invited to join the Master's level course Software Architecture and Design from the Applied Computing graduate program, an experience that deepened my understanding of system design and scalable solutions.

I firmly believe in the transformative power of clear, welcoming, and honest communication, in both professional and personal contexts. I see this as a starting point for leadership development, building friendships, and accomplishing ambitious projects.
